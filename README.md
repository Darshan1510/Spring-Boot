Basic Crud operations of spring boot


There are many things that should be consider while making spring boot project.
I have uploaded files which contains basic CRUD operations in spring boot technology. To learn any new technlogy like hibernate, spring , Spring Boot and also Servlet one should focus on their CRUD operations after learning the proper flow of that technology.

I will write 3-4 blogs covering all the CRUD operations and will share the link for the same. There will also be a case when someone needs foreign key for their projects. I am planning to learn all the operations for the foreign keys and upload for the same.

If you have any query, please post the issue so that I can work and we both have better understading of the error or problem.

To conclude,

I recommend you to use Eclipse while coding for the spring boot because it will provide you integrated maven developement kit and also set path variables for it. For mysql use Xampp and SqlYog to access and view the databases.

Happy Learning.
